## Education
California Polytechnic State University San Luis Obispo **(Cal Poly) - College of Engineering:**
Bachelor of Science in **Computer Science**, graduation: June 2020

## Skills
* **Languages:** C, C++, Python, Rust, Java, SAS, Racket
* **Systems & Frameworks:** Unix, OpenGL, OpenCL, Unity3D, KVM, Docker, SQL, Spark, Hadoop
* **Network Infrastructure:** Routing, Switching, Network Attached Storage, POE, Cabling

## Work Experience
* **Cal Poly Student Affairs Technology** - IT Specialist (April 2016 - June 2020)
    * Diagnosed, and resolved issues with the campus housing network and servers.
    * Provided broad technical support (software & hardware) for Windows and MacOS users of the campus network.
    * Maintained an internal website used to provide support to students in housing.

* **UHV Technologies** - Intern (May 2015 â€“ Sep 2015)
    * Assisted in the design process, digitizing and modeling engineering plans with CAD.
    * Prototyped a linear encoder measurement device (hardware and software).

## Projects
* **Ray Tracer:** Wrote a multithreaded, physically based renderer that parses and renders a subset of the POV-Ray scene description standard. The renderer applies rudimentary kinematics to produce successive frames for an output video. 

* **Tie-Dye Pixel Art Renderer:** Wrote a Python program (also re-written in Rust) for rendering pixel art imagery inspired by classic tie-dye patterns. The program has many different operational modes and can run on a GPU using OpenCL.

* **Animation Blending in OpenGL:** Created an animation in C++ and OpenGL where a model skeleton goes through a series of dances with animation blending. The models and dance animations were extracted from the Unreal Engine game Fortnite.

* **Music Visualizer:** Wrote an audio visualization program in C++ and OpenGL where the user could fly around a procedurally generated landscape while the texture and height of the landscape react to audio captured from the system.

* **Networked Chat Client/Server:** Wrote a chat program in C that uses TCP to convey messages between multiple clients. 

* **Network Packet Analyzer:** Wrote a C program that uses the NPCAP library to inspect packets functioning like a basic version of Wireshark.

* **AI Video Summarization Tool:** Worked with a group to create a utility that takes large amounts of security camera video and applies AI image recognition to pare down the footage into a short summary.

* **System Building & Home Networking:** Built a home virtualization server to use as a NAS, DNS resolver, security gateway, Docker host, batch renderer, and game server.
